	<h1>Hi there, I'm Joel Van Veluwen!</h1>
	<p>I'm an aspirant data scientist who gets to work with some amazing data assets at <a href='https://www.linkedin.com'>LinkedIn.com</a>
	<br><a href="/about">Read more about my life over at the "about" page.</a></p>
	
	<p>This page will serve primarily as my non-professional web presence. 
	Somewhere to post ad-hoc analysis (over at my blog 'When a chart hits our eyes'), personal interests and projects. 
	Plus it is a pretty decent way to touch front-end development and actually use my public github account.</p>
	
	<p>For all things professional go ahead and reach out to my on LinkedIn or email</p>
