	<h1>About me</h1>
</div><!-- /.blurb -->
<p>I am currently based in Sydney, Australia working for the world's largest professional network - <b>LinkedIn</b>.</p>
<p>Prior to LinkedIn I was working at Quantium leveraging one of Australia's largest transaction sets to deliver the engine that drives Woolworths' loyalty personalisation efforts. I also got to work with some of the largest FMCG players in Australia.</p>
<p>Before starting my career in analytics I completed a dual degree program at The University of Queensland and was awarded degrees in Econommics and Commerce (Information Systems).</p>
<p>On the technology side - I'm a huge advocate for <a href="http://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a> (a powerful cluster computing framework for analytics), <a href="https://zeppelin.apache.org/">Apache Zeppelin</a> (an awesome data science notebook that can issue workflows to Spark) and D3.JS for data visualisation.</p>
