title: "d3.js on Jekyll"
---

##Intro

So, [d3.js][link] has been around for a moment now and I guess it's good time to start playing with it!

##Trivia

It needs extra steps implementing d3.js onto Jekyll, especially when we're working on Markdown instead of HTML. But, with
proper anchor, it's like taking a candy from a baby. Cheers.
