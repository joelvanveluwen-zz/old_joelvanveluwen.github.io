This blog has been a long time coming. Over the course of my career I have almost always worked in a space where I can't share what I am working on due to the discretion afforded to me to deliver products and insights based on sensitive customer data. I am still in this position at LinkedIn - so I thought rather than using it as an excuse not to publish that I would instead turn to develop my analytical, writing and blogging skills on publically available or self-generated data sets. 

The name of this blog "When a chart hits our eyes" comes from a chapter of Scott Berinato's "Good Charts" and attempts to capture some of goals I have for this blog. The chapter explores how people typically have a perspective on something without necessarily exploring the evidence. The key message I want to share is how we can leverage analytics and science to uncover insights from data and communicate them in a useful way. 

In the blogosphere I am seeing plenty of "big data" and "data science" blogs that show off advanced analytics or analytics at scale - but not so much content that actually demonstrates real value or use cases. This is where this blog will hopefully step in as a place to showcase some applied analytics.

Please note that opinions shared on this blog are my own and not that of my employer.
